## 2. Docker-Compose: Run The Enterprise Stack

Use docker-compose to bring up the Enterprise Stack API, UI (soon) and a MongoDB database (storage of the Enterprise Stack).  

You can update the version of the enterprise stack via the `.env` file. 

### Use docker-compose

**Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-enterprise-quickstart.git
```

**Change Working Directory**
```bash
cd waltid-enterprise-quickstart
```

**Run The Stack**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once the docker-compose is running, you can visit [enterprise.localhost:3000/swagger](http://enterprise.localhost:3000/swagger) to access the Enterprise Stack APIs.
